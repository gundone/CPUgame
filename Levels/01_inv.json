  "description": "Create an inverter: output should be opposite of input",
  "fullDescription": "The inverter (NOT gate) is the simplest logic gate. It outputs the opposite of its input: when input is 0, output is 1, and vice versa. Inverters are fundamental building blocks used in almost every digital circuit, from flip-flops to complex processors. Build it using a single NAND gate by connecting both inputs together.",
