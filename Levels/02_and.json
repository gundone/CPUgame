  "fullDescription": "The AND gate outputs 1 only when ALL inputs are 1. It's used for combining conditions - like checking if multiple requirements are met simultaneously. In processors, AND gates are used in address decoding, masking operations, and control logic. Hint: NAND is 'NOT AND', so to make AND, you need to invert the NAND output.",
