  "description": "Create a gated D latch: when CLK is high, Q follows D",
  "fullDescription": "The D flip-flop (or D latch) is the fundamental building block of digital memory. It has a data input (D), a clock/enable input (CLK), and an output (Q). When CLK is HIGH, the latch is 'transparent' and Q follows D. When CLK goes LOW, Q holds its last value. This level tests the transparent behavior - when CLK=1, Q must equal D. Build it using NAND gates: you'll need a pair of cross-coupled NANDs for the SR latch core, plus input gating.",
